# wrapped_generator
Generate a "Spotify Wrapped" playlist for a given year using historic Last.fm data.

To use this program you will need a Last.fm account with data from before you Spotify introduced Wrapped (2016). You will also need to have [api keys for Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications), which this program expects to find in your environment variables.
